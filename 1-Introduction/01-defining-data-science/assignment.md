# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Education | The need to improve the education process | (structured data)lessons offered, number of kids in a classroom, student to teacher ratio, student performance in the various lessons, time of the day when the lessons are taught | Can be stored in a relational database| decide whether a given teacher with different teaching methods is the reason for good performance in a given lesson, whether children perform better in lessons offered at a given time of the day, if the teacher to student ratio is affecting the children's performance |
| Vaccination | How to control vaccinations in a pandemic | the ages of those catching the disease, the location of affected people, social habits of the affected people | | Data lake as this involves data from across the globe | if a given age group is most affected we concentrate on distributing the vaccine to them fast, if people in given locations are affected due to the weather the vaccine should be distributed to them first, people in jobs that involve alot of interaction reporting most cases should be given priority|
| Productivity | measuring staff productivity | KPIs of the staff across the days and weeks, customer complaints regarding work done, supervisor feedback regarding work done, staff trainings offered and taken| database| the times of the day when staff are productive as well as the days of the week when they are most productive, whether staff performance improves if they countuously improve themselves with training |

## Rubric

Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement
--- | --- | -- |
One was able to identify reasonable data sources, ways of storing data and possible decisions/insights for all problem domains | Some of the aspects of the solution are not detailed, data storage is not discussed, at least 2 problem domains are described | Only parts of the data solution are described, only one problem domain is considered.
